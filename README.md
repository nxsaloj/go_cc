# Golang Coding Challenges

Welcome! 👋🏼

A while back, I was considering learning GoLang, and the time has come...
This is a monorepo for my golang learning, based on the challenges by John Cricket <https://codingchallenges.fyi/>, it's focused on building real world apps and the challenges are language agnostic, the intention is to practice and follow GoLang's best practices. Visit their documentation on <https://go.dev/doc/effective_go>.
